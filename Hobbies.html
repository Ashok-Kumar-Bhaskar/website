          Play is the word that describes the way kids try on this vast world for size and their 
          place in it with imagination. Learning is more than pencil paper and pen and I did my 
          learning with cricket bats and tennis rackets like every other kid in my neighborhood 
          during my childhood summers. And I still do those even as an adult mostly to keep up 
          with my fitness and health.<br>
          <br>Film is a great tool to play with human emotions and I let that play with mine a 
          lot more than others. South Indian movies irrespective of the language have me in a craze 
          that would not be enough to describe me as a Cinebuff and a superstar fanboy.<br>
          <br>Theatre is the art of looking at ourselves and I love looking at me
          through dramas and streetplays. The things we do for ourselves definitely is self care,
          but helping others is selfless care and I try to be selfless by being a part of 
          community outreach groups and service organization such as Bhoomi.
